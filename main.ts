// Task 12: Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name,

// but each message should be personalized with the person’s name?

// Task 13: Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation,
// such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several 
//examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, 
//such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

// Task 14:Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite?
// Make a list that includes at least three people you’d like to invite to dinner. 
//Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.
